On the release of Patch 0.12.12 we had more CCU and the backend was more overloaded than now.\n\nSome issues show themselves only under heavy load (like the one we're currently experiencing) and \"buying more servers\" won't fix these issues. Such heavy load occurs during prime time only and it's been far heavier than one or two years ago, as the game became more complex.\n\nWe are working on identifying the nature of these issues and on how to lower the chanсe of them happening in the future. Our methods include replacing hardware, eliminating unstable nodes and adding changes to the software, for example a temporary queue system and different kinds of backend optimizations.\n\nThe queuing mechanism in the launcher has been introduced in order to prevent the backend servers from overloading and avoid game-related issues resulting from that overload. This is a temporary solution. We are working to reduce queues as soon as possible and our goal is to eliminate them completely.\n\nOur team will continue to work during the holidays until we resolve these issues.\n\nWe apologize for the inconvenience caused and thank you for your patience and support. @news","authorID":"824166816338542622","pinned":false,"tts":false,"nonce":null,"embeds":[],"attachments":[],"createdTimestamp":1641165585019,"editedTimestamp":1641165907983,"webhookID":"824166816338542622","applicationID":null,"activity":null,"flags":2,"guildID":"562501878903078922","cleanContent":"Dear players,\n\nOur servers are currently overloaded, but this is not related to the Twitch Drops event we're running. On the release of Patch 0.12.12 we had more CCU and the backend was more overloaded than now.\n\nSome issues show themselves only under heavy load (like the one we're currently experiencing) and \"buying more servers\" won't fix these issues. Such heavy load occurs during prime time only and it's been far heavier than one or two years ago, as the game became more complex.\n\nWe are working on identifying the nature of these issues and on how to lower the chanсe of them happening in the future. Our methods include replacing hardware, eliminating unstable nodes and adding changes to the software, for example a temporary queue system and different kinds of backend optimizations.\n\nThe queuing mechanism in the launcher has been introduced in order to prevent the backend servers from overloading and avoid game-related issues resulting from that overload. This is a temporary solution. We are working to reduce queues as soon as possible and our goal is to eliminate them completely.\n\nOur team will continue to work during the holidays until we resolve these issues.\n\nWe apologize for the inconvenience caused and thank you for your patience and support. @news"},{"channelID":"824166584816893973","deleted":false,"id":"927325337560436777","type":"DEFAULT","system":false,"content":"The special event \"Emissary Duos\" is live!

Along with misfires, weapons can now suffer the following malfunctions:\n\n**Failure to eject** - after firing, the cartridge is jammed by the bolt and is partially visible in the ejection port. The source of this problem is, first of all, the technical condition of the weapon, and less often - the overheating of the weapon and the cartridge characteristics.\n\n**Failure to feed** - after firing, there are issues with the new cartridge feed (round gets stuck in the mechanisms of the weapon, cartridge case, etc.). The main source of this problem is the weapon magazine, especially the high capacity and drum magazines. Other sources: cartridge characteristics, weapon overheating, and technical condition of the weapon.\n\n**Jammed bolt** - after firing, the bolt gets jammed. Jamming can be of two types: normal and hard. The only difference is the duration of the troubleshooting. The cause of the jammed bolt can only be overheating of the weapon or its technical condition.

Effects: heating of the barrel, muzzle devices, and handguard is visible in thermal scopes, possible mirage (heat haze) from the barrel and muzzle devices.\n**Medium overheating **- the weapon is heated, reddening of the barrel and muzzle devices is visible. Effects: weapon’s accuracy decreases, malfunction chance increases, wear increases, and the weapon’s maximum durability is reduced during firing.\n**Severe overheating** - the weapon is very hot, the barrel and muzzle devices are sizzling hot.

We would like to remind you that there is going be a wipe with this patch, which means that the progress of your account will be reset.\n\n**Patch 0.12.12**\n\nKey changes:\n\n**1**. Added the Lighthouse location. The lighthouse at Cape Dalniy was an important strategic object on the way to Tarkov. During Contract Wars, it was the main entry point for USEC units and served as their base of operations. After the conflict, Scavs took a fancy to this place, until the old owners returned, who decided to stay in Tarkov and establish their own order.\n\nThis is the first iteration of this location. In the future, the territory will be expanded and will include new Bosses.\n\n**2**. The Lighthouse location will feature a new AI type - ex-USEC operatives, also called Rogues. They are a gang of former PMCs who previously operated together. They are well-armed, well trained, and use coordinated combat tactics. They have similar interests to the Raiders’ ones, but have united around a shared military past.\n\nRogue USECs have taken over the water treatment plant, and entrenched there. Stationary machine guns and grenade launchers are set up along the perimeter, with several fighters patrolling around the clock. When an enemy is detected in a sector of fire or there is a suspicion of enemy presence, the guards open suppressive fire, trying to prevent the enemy from approaching their territory.\n\nThese new bots are lenient towards the USEC PMC faction. They will not open fire upon a USEC player unless the player tries to enter their territory. If the player gets too close, he will receive an order to leave immediately and will be shot if not compliant. Also, if a USEC player is in a group with a BEAR PMC, both of them will be considered hostile and attacked on sight without a warning.\n\nIf a USEC player engages in a fight with the Rogues, he will be considered a traitor and will be treated as a hostile for the next several raids.\n\n**3**. Inertia has been added to the game for more realistic movement and actions. Inertia manifests itself in the following situations:\n\n- Walking and strafing\n- Sprinting\n- Sharp turns during sprinting\n- Landing after jumping or falling from a height\n- Leaning and sidestepping\n\nThe inertial force depends on the weight of equipment and the Strength skill level. The more your equipment weighs and the lower the Strength skill level is:\n\n- The longer it takes to accelerate at the start of movement (walk, strafe, sprint);\n- The longer it takes to slow down after stopping movement (walk, strafe, sprint);\n- The longer it takes to slow down and accelerate when changing movement direction to the opposite one;\n- The more movement speed decreases during sharp turns while sprinting;\n- The stronger and longer movement speed decreases when landing after jumping or falling from a height;\n- The slower it takes to lean, return to normal position from leaning, and sidestep.\n\nThe inertial force increases starting from 0 kg of equipment weight for characters with Strength level 0, and from 10 kg for characters with the Elite Strength level. The inertial force reaches maximum with 70 kg of equipment weight for characters with Strength level 0, and with 80 kg for characters with the Elite Strength level.\n\n**4**. Expanded crouching and getting up mechanics. Now the duration of these actions depends on the degree of weight overload. Getting up drains stamina, the amount of spent stamina depends on the degree of overload and the number of changed stance bars (how high the character stood up).","authorID":"824166816338542622","pinned":false,"tts":false,"nonce":null,"embeds":[],"attachments":[],"createdTimestamp":1639302035339,"editedTimestamp":0,"webhookID":"824166816338542622","applicationID":null,"activity":null,"flags":2,"guildID":"562501878903078922","cleanContent":"We present the Escape from Tarkov 0.12.12 patch notes.
